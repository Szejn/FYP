Project Statement

The aim of this project is to create a program that will
analyze the text of a novel, short story or play/screenplay using Natural
Language Processing (NLP) techniques, such as
Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Coreference
Resolution. Using these techniques the program will
learn to differentiate or recognise which words are the
names or pronouns referring to specific characters. The
program will then create a graph of the interaction
between the various characters over the course of the
source text.
